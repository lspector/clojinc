;; clojinc
;; Steps toward clojure, starting from zero.
;; by Lee Spector <lspector@hampshire.edu>, 2011-2017
;; Version (date): 20170914

;; This file is a saved, re-executable Clojure REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) 
;; session, with minimal comments and occasional problem sets. It is intended
;; to serve as the starting-point for semi-independent learning of the Clojure
;; programming language, for people who have at least some minimal experience
;; with at least one (any) programming language. No help is provided here for
;; getting a Clojure implementation/REPL up and running; consult the online
;; resources listed below, or search the web, if you need help with that.

;; The format of this file is alternating Clojure expressions with 
;; commented-out output (including both the output produced by explicit print  
;; statements and the values returned by the evaluated expressions). You should 
;; be able to proceed through the file, evaluating an expression at a time, and   
;; if you do this you should get the same output (or similar output, in cases 
;; that involve nondeterminism). In many cases later expressions rely on having
;; evaluated earlier expressions in the file.

;; The material in this file is informal and idiosyncratic in its coverage, 
;; leaving out many things that other Clojure introductions include and revealing 
;; the Lisp-oriented bias of the author. The intention is just to lead beginners
;; deeply enough into Clojure territory for them to proceed in other directions
;; on their own.

;; More specifically, we begin with simple expressions for arithmetic and list
;; manipulation, introduce facilities for defining functions and macros, and give
;; progressively more complex examples of definitions that involve many of
;; Clojure's data structures including lists, vectors, maps, and sets. Among the
;; applications used for examples and problem sets are grammar-driven text
;; generation, genetic programming, and simple graphics. We also demonstrate
;; alternatives for defining iterative and recursive algorithms and briefly touch
;; upon topics ranging from debugging and profiling to file I/O and concurrency. 

;; Many things are introduced here without explanation. My suggestion is that 
;; you observe the output that is provided here, look things up in online resources 
;; and in documentation that may be available in your Clojure environment, and, 
;; most crucially, experiment with variations of the expressions presented here. 
;; The problem sets are prods for further experimentation but it is best to  
;; experiment continuously. Some of the problems provided here are easy, some are 
;; quite hard, and many could be completed/varied/extended in several different
;; ways.

;; Potentially useful online resources include:

;; http://clojure.org
;; https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started
;; http://groups.google.com/group/clojure
;; https://4clojure.oxal.org
;; http://clojuredocs.org
;; http://www.clojure-toolbox.com
;; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaLlzGqiPE2QRj6sSOawJRg
;; http://planet.clojure.in/

;; Most of the outputs in clojinc were created using clojure version 1.3 in a
;; REPL started with Leiningen 1.7.1 (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
;; and using Java 1.6.0_33. (A few were left from an earlier version, for which
;; Clooj (https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj) was used.

;; Atoms manage global items (single items) that two threads shouldn't

;; "atomic"). If you try to change an atom and it is busy then your change
;; will be retried. So the code that you use to change it should not have side

;; Here is a recursive version that uses recur for the recursive step
;; in order to avoid the potential memory problems for large inputs.
;; The first implementation allows the user to call the function normally,
;; with just the input, but the second implementation takes a second 
;; argument into which the answer is accumulated.

(defn factorial
  ([n]
    (factorial n 1))
  ([n accumulator]
    (if (< n 2)
      accumulator
      (recur (dec n) (* n accumulator)))))

; 120



;; Here is another functional-style version which is both elegant
;; and efficient in Clojure. First we produce a sequence of numbers
;; from 0 to n-1 using range. Then we map inc (which adds 1) down that
;; sequence, producing a sequence from 1 to n. Then we apply * to the
;; result, and return the result of that.

(defn factorial
  [n]
  (apply * (map inc (range n))))

; #'clojinc.core/factorial



;; Here's a slightly different version that avoids the call to map
;; by calling range with two values to produce the right sequence in
;; the first place:

(defn factorial
  [n]
  (apply * (range 1 (inc n))))

; #'clojinc.core/factorial



;; Note that "apply" in the last two examples could be replaced by "reduce".
;; With "apply" each of these makes a single call to "*", with all of the 
;; arguments at once. Using "reduce" would do the same job by calling "*"
;; first on the first two numbers, then again on the result of that first
;; multiplication and the third number, etc. Both "apply" and "reduce" are
;; handy for a variety of purposes, but in this case they both happen to
;; produce the same result (because of the way that "*" works).

;; An alternative approach, which is messy in this case (at least as done
;; here!) but can sometimes be elegant is to create an infinite lazy sequence.
;; We create an infinite lazy sequence of pairs [i i!] (that is, a number
;; and its factorial). We do this by calling iterate, telling it to start
;; with [1 1], and telling it to get the next pair from the current pair by
;; making the first number one higher and the second number the result of 
;; multiplying the current second number by the new first number.

(def all-factorials (iterate 
                      (fn [[i fact]] [(inc i) (* fact (inc i))]) 
                      [1 1]))

; #'clojinc.core/all-factorials



;; We can pull out the right pair for the input n using nth. Since we only want
;; the factorial, not the pair, we call second to return just the factorial. 
;; What is the right index to pass to nth? The sequence looks like
;; this: ([1 1] [2 2] [3 6] [4 24] [5 120] [6 720] ...)
;; Since nth is zero-based we want to look at index 0 for the factorial
;; of 1, index 1 for the factorial of 2, etc., which means we want
;; to look at index (dec n). 

(defn factorial
  [n]
  (second (nth all-factorials (dec n))))

; #'clojinc.core/factorial



(factorial 5)

; 120



;; Another way to pull out the right pair is to search all-factorials
;; for a pair with a first number equal to n. 

(defn factorial 
  [n]
  (second (first (filter  #(= (first %) n) all-factorials))))

; #'clojinc.core/factorial



(factorial 5)

;; Note, however, that this will loop forever if you ask for the factorial
;; of 0 or a negative number. The other versions above will either return
;; the wrong answer (since there is no right answer!) or produce an error
;; if you ask them to do this, which you shouldn't anyway. But the infinite
;; loop is perhaps the nastiest way to handle this.



;; Problem Set 12:
;; - Write Clojure functions for several of the recursive functions that are 
;;   listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)
;;   other than factorial. Try to write versions in several of the styles
;;   that were presented above for factorial.

;; defines an expression that evaluates to another expression which is then

;; We can define our own macro to build an abstraction
;; of the "arithmetic if" pattern used above.

;; Macros are defined with defmacro, and they specify

; (if (clojure.core/< 1 2) 3 (clojure.core/cond (clojure.core/= 1 2) 4 :else 5))



;; The fact that this is a macro, and not a function, is
;; made clear by providing expressions that have side-effects
;; (like printing) for the "eval-if-..." clauses, and seeing 
;; that only the matching clause is executed:

               2

               (println :equal)
